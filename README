INTRODUCTION
------------
Welcome to LARS: it's Like a Rental System.

This project demonstrates an implementation of design work produced throughout
the rest of the semester, including data definitions, class layout, and GRASP
concepts.

RUNNING
-------
The main method can be found in lars.LARS. Based on command line arguments, it
can start one of three modes: 
- No argument will launch kiosk mode: the main, fullscreen interface intended
  for use by customers.
- "-admin" will launch administrative mode: the data viewing and modification
  interface intended for use by staff.
- "-setup" will initialize the database. This must be run before the system can
  be used.
  - "-demo" used in conjunction with "-setup" will initialize the database with
    some sample data for demonstration purposes.
